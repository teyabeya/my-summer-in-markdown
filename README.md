# SUMMER 2024

## My new favorite series
This summer I read the <u>A Good Girl's Guide to Murder</u> trilogy by Holly Jackson. As someone who likes listening to true crime, this was a perfect fit for me. The included books were:

* A Good Girl's Guide to Murder
* Good Girl, Bad Blood
* As Good As Dead

My personal favorite was **As Good As Dead** because the plot twists just pulled the entire series in full circle.

## Summer School
Summer school with my friends in PE was so much fun this year. We played volleyball, badminton, and played cards. We also made some bracelets and brought cupcakes for a couple of summer birthdays.

## I scream for ice cream
Ice cream is the obvious favorite for a hot and sunny summer. My favorite ice cream flavor is Neapolitan because it has 3 classics in one: chocolate, vanilla, and ice cream.

## Picnic
I think the best way to start a school year is with a picnic. Some friends and I got together the week before school started to have a potluck picnic. Its the best way to hangout and compare schedules before the school year begins.

## Stars
As I had left over yarn from a community service event, I figured I needed to do something with it, so I made a couple star pouches, one I used for summer school, and one I keep on my back pack. It's not the most professional work, but it's functional.
