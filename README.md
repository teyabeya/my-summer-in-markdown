# SUMMER 2024

## My new favorite series
This summer I read the <u>A Good Girl's Guide to Murder</u> trilogy by Holly Jackson. As someone who likes listening to true crime, this was a perfect fit for me. Each book seemed to be better than the last and I could never seem to predict the ending twists. The included books were:

1. A Good Girl's Guide to Murder
2. Good Girl, Bad Blood
3. As Good As Dead

My personal favorite was **As Good As Dead** because the plot twists showed just how insane Pip had gotten. Though the last book was by far the most unrealistic, I think it pulled the entire series in full circle and tied all loose ends.

## Summer School
Last summer before freshman year, I took the opportunity to do a semester of PE at school. I had never met majority of the friends I made there before the start of summer school, and probably would have never interacted with them otherwise. This year was a bit different as I had summer school with my friends in PE this year which was so much fun. We played volleyball, badminton, and played many cards. We also made some bracelets together and brought cupcakes for a couple of summer birthdays.

## I scream for ice cream
Ice cream is the obvious favorite for a hot and sunny summer. It's cold, sweet, and refreshing, especially after a day at summer school. Specifically, my family favors the Tillamook brand, as all their flavors are rich, milky, and high quality. My favorite ice cream flavor is Neapolitan because it has 3 classics in one: 

* chocolate
* vanilla
* strawberry

## Picnic
I think the best way to start a school year is with a picnic. The summer before freshman year, I got together with my closest friends from middle school to have a picnic at a park to recap all the middle school drama. This year, I got together with friends I had made last school year the week before school started to have a potluck picnic. It's the best way to hang out and compare schedules before the school year begins. I'm so glad we got together before school like a final goodbye to summer with cool drinks and sweet treats.

## Stars
As I had left over yarn from a community service event, I figured I needed to do something with it. I made a couple star pouches, one I used for summer school, and one I keep on my back pack. I made these through a simple beginner tutorial on youtube, but it's pretty easy to follow. I don't think it's a hobby I'll consistantly keep doing, but it was very addictive after I got the hang of it. The pouches aren't the most professional pieces of work, but it's functional.
